CHANGE LOG

4/8/2021
1. Solution generation has been moved from the solution type file to a seperate class. 
   This change was made because there is no real reason for solution generation to be performed
   in the solution_type class. All decision variables should be readily interpretable through the
   decision variable map so there is not a need.

2. This makes it necessary to add a fixed solution, True or False, key to the common input file.
   This key is not a large change though, and is better than current methods.

3.
