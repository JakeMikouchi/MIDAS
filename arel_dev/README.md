# modularOptimizationFramework
A repository containing the Modular Optimization Framework (MOF) for solving nuclear engineering design problems. 

MOF is designed to provide users with a variety of optimization methodologies to solve various nuclear engineering design problems. Containing multiple optimization methodologies in a single package allows for the reuse of code in multiple ways leading to a shorter, simpler, and more versatile optimization package.

Current optimization methodologies supported by the MOF are:

    Genetic Algorithm
